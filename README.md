# CourseLLM

## Purpose
CourseLLM (Coursewise) is an educational platform that leverages AI to provide personalized learning experiences. 
It is intended for Undergraduate University Courses and is being tested on Computer Science courses.

The project provides role-based dashboards for students and teachers, integrated authentication via Firebase, and AI-powered course assessment and tutoring. 

The core goals are to:
- Enable personalized learning assessment and recommendations for students
- Provide Socratic-style course tutoring through AI chat
